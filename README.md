# modded-darkreader

a modified dark reader extension to match with wallpaper colors

the extension is from firefox but it'll work on chromium browsers 

what is modded:

background/index.js (CTRL + F and MOD1)

inject/index.js (CTRL + F and MOD2 MOD3 MOD4 MOD5)

basically i edited the colour filter matrix (used for speia and grayscale filters) per every wallpaper colour change
